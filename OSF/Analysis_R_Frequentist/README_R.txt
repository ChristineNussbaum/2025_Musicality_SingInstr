This folder contains the preprocessed data together with all analysis R-scripts that were used for the frequentist analysis. 

In order to run the R-scripts, one needs the subfolders "input", "output", "plots" and "functions" in the folder where the scripts are stored.

The "input"-folder contains the preprocessed raw data. It contains an extra subfolder "orig_data_Nussbaum2024", which contains the data about professionals and non-musicians from the previous publication (Nussbaum et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1111/bjop.12684)

The "functions"-folder contains some customized functions for the analysis. If you use any of these functions for your own analysis, please cite the paper corresponding to the project.

The "output"-folder and the "plots"-folder can be empty, since the output will be created while running the scripts. 

The scripts are numbered, but this does not imply that they have to be run in a particular order. The names of the scripts also contain an indication, to which part of the manuscript (part I-III) they belong. 

If you have any problems or concerns regarding the R-scripts, please feel free to contact the author. 

If you use any of the functions, data or code snippets, please cite the publication associated with the OSF-repository. If you are unsure how to cite this work, feel free to contact the author.
