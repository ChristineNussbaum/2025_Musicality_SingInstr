In this folder, you can find a small selection of our stimuli as examples. 

The original voice recordings that served as a basis for creating our stimulus material were provided by Sascha Frühholz from the Department of Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience of the University of Zurich,  similar to the ones used in Frühholz et al. (2015).
