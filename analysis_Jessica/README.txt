This folder contains the preprocessed data together with all analysis R-scripts. 

In order to run the R-scripts, one needs the subfolders "input", "output", "plots" and "functions" in the folder where the scripts are stored.

	The "input"-folder contains the preprocessed raw data. 

	The "functions"-folder contains some customized functions for the analysis. If you use any of these functions for your own analysis, 
	please cite the paper corresponding to the project.

	The "output"-folder and the "plots"-folder can be empty, since the output will be created while running the scripts. 

The scripts are numbered, but this does not always imply that they have to be run in a particular order. 
	
	The first two scripts (01a & 01b) are data preparation and prerequisitive for running all other scripts.
	
	Script "07_data_preparation_Correlations" is a prerequisitive for correlational analyses in the scripts 08a through 12.	

	Except for the R-scripts 01a and 01b, all scripts with the suffix "a" analyze the data of amateurs (N = 88), 
	while scripts with the suffix "b" analyze the data of amateurs, professionals and non-musicians (N = 166) of the combined data sets of this study and the study 
	by Nussbaum, Schirmer & Schweinberger (2023; "Musicality â€“ Tuned to the Melody of Vocal Emotions").

If you have any problems or concerns regarding the R-scripts, please feel free to contact the authors. 

If you use any of the functions, data or code snippets, please cite the publication associated with the OSF-repository. 
If you are unsure how to cite this work, feel free to contact the author (Christine Nussbaum).
